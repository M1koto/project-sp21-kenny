Reflection
I started by using brute force to find the cities , or nodes, that contribute to decreasing the most for shortest path by using a loop for all cities and taking them out from the graph and comparing how much the minimum distance increased. Then, for rotes, or edges, I used greedy algorithm and found the shortest path using dijkstra then greedily remove the edge that contributes the least to the minimum path. For both k and c, I would check if it is a possible solution first, while repeating k times and c times separately. I did not specifically use any other computational resource except my computer.
